    <H2>Californication</H2>

    <br>
    Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation<br>
    And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation<br>
    And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication<br>
    <br>
    It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization<br>
    The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location<br>
    It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication<br>
    <br>
    Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
    Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?<br>
    <br>
    First born unicorn<br>
    Hardcore soft porn<br>
    Dream of Californication<br>

    <br>
    Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation<br>
    A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information<br>
    And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication<br>
    <br>
    Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement<br>
    And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?<br>
    And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication<br>
    <br>
    Born and raised by those who praise control of population<br>
    Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation<br>
    <br>
    First born unicorn<br>
    Hardcore soft porn<br>

    Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation<br>
    And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration<br>
    And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication<br>
    <br>
    Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
    Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?<br>

    <h2>Nothing Else Matters</h2>

    <br>
    So close, no matter how far<br>
    Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
    Forever trusting who we are<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Never opened myself this way<br>
    Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
    All these words, I don't just say<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
    Every day for us something new<br>
    Open mind for a different view<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Never cared for what they do<br>
    Never cared for what they know<br>
    But I know<br>
    <br>
    So close, no matter how far<br>
    It couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
    Forever trusting who we are<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Never cared for what they do<br>
    Never cared for what they know<br>
    But I know<br>
    <br>
    I never opened myself this way<br>
    Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
    All these words, I don't just say<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
    Every day for us something new<br>
    Open mind for a different view<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>
    <br>
    Never cared for what they say<br>
    Never cared for games they play<br>
    Never cared for what they do<br>
    Never cared for what they know<br>
    And I know, yeah, yeah<br>
    <br>
    So close, no matter how far<br>
    Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
    Forever trusting who we are<br>
    No, nothing else matters<br>

    <h2>The Unforgiven</h2>
    <audio src="musicas/Metallica - The Unforgiven (Official Music Video)-null.mp3" controls></audio>
    <br>
    New blood joins this Earth<br>
    And quickly he's subdued<br>
    Through constant pained disgrace<br>
    The young boy learns their rules<br>
    <br>
    With time the child draws in<br>
    This whipping boy done wrong<br>
    Deprived of all his thoughts<br>
    The young man struggles on and on, he's known<br>
    <br>
    Ooh, a vow unto his own<br>
    That never from this day<br>
    His will they'll take away<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never be, never see<br>
    Won't see what might have been<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    <br>
    They dedicate their lives<br>
    To running all of his<br>
    He tries to please them all<br>
    This bitter man he is<br>
    <br>
    Throughout his life the same<br>
    He's battled constantly<br>
    This fight he cannot win<br>
    A tired man they see no longer cares<br>
    <br>
    The old man then prepares<br>
    To die regretfully<br>
    That old man here is me<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never be, never see<br>
    Won't see what might have been<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never be, never see<br>
    Won't see what might have been<br>
    <br>
    What I've felt, what I've known<br>
    Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    Oh-ooh-oh<br>
    <br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    You labeled me, I'll label you<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    <br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    You labeled me, I'll label you<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
    <br>
    Never free, never me<br>
    So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
